> ## *day 30/11/2021*
> We will use a dataset built with [JVCScrapper](https://github.com/Brotherta/JVCScraper). The aim of today is to analyse our data.
> First of all we will compute the mean of the length of either positive and negative reviews. 
> We want to prevent our predictor to base its judgement on the length of the review.
